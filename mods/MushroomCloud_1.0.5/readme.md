# Mushroom Cloud
---
## Introduction

The atomic bomb. It delivers a huge amount of firepower and is everyone's favorite wood trimmer. But its appearance in Factorio is kind of unimpressive. Its ring of fire looks cool - for the first five times. In addition, the use of nukes is usually completely silent. And if it weren't for the tree stumps (standing there, quiet as the nuke itself), nobody would notice it's use anyway.

And therefore, nukes need an upgrade! 

## Details

This mod does two things:

- Firstly, it adds a mushroom cloud explosion animation, which was originally created for the now abandoned Uranium Power mod. 
- Secondly, this mod informs you about every nuclear detonation within 25 thousand tiles/meters by playing a explosion sound. If your are far away from the explosion (imagine targeting a biter nest with a **[M.I.R.V](https://mods.factorio.com/mods/Klonan/MIRV)**), you'll just hear some echoes. If a nuclear explosion goes off within a kilometer or less, the sound will be much more intense. And firing a nuke next to you will result in an earsplitting, awe-inspiring detonation sound. (I tried very hard to get the most promising nuke detonation sound from freesound.org - and i think i found it.)

All values (i.e. which sound will be played in dependence of the distance to the detonation) are fully configurable.

### Now, just grab some nukes and turn up your speakers - and have fun!
